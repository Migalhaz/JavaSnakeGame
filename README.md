# SNAKE GAME
---
## Disclaimer
This repo is just a small project to learn java syntax.
I've tried to use some design patterns and OOP that I know from other languages.
As a learning project there are probably many better ways to do everything I've done in the project.

## Notes
  - I've been having a good time with java (red flag) with some considerations.
  - why are there so many words????
  - I'm not the biggest fan of creating a new file for each class but I prefer to think of it as organization.
  - Too much work to set the things up.
  - Function declaration inside new objects declaration???? IT'S HORRIBLE REALLY WEIRD
  - I've missed structs T-T
